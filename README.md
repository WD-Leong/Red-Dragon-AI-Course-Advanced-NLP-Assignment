# Red-Dragon-AI-Course-Advanced-NLP-Assignment

## Movie Dialogue Chatbot
We now move on to the 2nd assignment, which is an NLP project of our choice. This assignment trains a movie dialogue chatbot using a [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) network. The pre-processing of the data follow this [script](https://github.com/suriyadeepan/datasets/blob/master/seq2seq/cornell_movie_corpus/scripts/prepare_data.py) closely. The data can be obtained [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html).
